Eirik Steira

Stian Mogen

Nicolay Schi√∏ll Johansen

The program is created for a project in the NTNU course IDATT2104. The team was tasked to create a STUN-server with a P2P client application.
We were not supposed to create a complete implementation of a STUN-server, but rather add functionality we saw fit, and also preparing it for further work in the future.
Implementation of the server needed to be inn accordance with [RFC 5389](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389), which we tried to consider throughout the entire development process.
